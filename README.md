#### Project1

  This project demonstrates the use of an AWS Lambda function to copy objects from one S3 bucket to another automatically when new objects are uploaded to the source bucket. 
  The Lambda function is triggered by an S3 event notification and utilizes the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to copy the object to the destination bucket.
